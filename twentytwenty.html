			Hello everyone. Sorry I haven't updated you all in a while. I know millions of people are just pacing the floor waiting for an update. I spent the weekend out of town, and I got to see my family and my cute little dog. My sisters made him a little handkerchief and he looks adorable in it. <br>
			I also got to spend a lot of time with my girlfriend! She's so awesome. She brought me a soda and we played Portal 2 together. She's Atlas and I'm P-Body, in case you were wondering. We also sat in the hot tub and just chatted. I love my girlfriend so much, she's an amazing person.<br>
			I drove back to college this morning and now I'm just back to work. I'm going back home this Friday to celebrate my mom's birthday and then stay for Thanksgiving Break, so that's exciting. I love spending time with my family and my dog and my girlfriend!!! <3

			Welcome to November everyone. GO VOTE!!!<br>
			Well I hope everyone had a fun and safe Halloween. I went on a little road trip with my girlfriend and some of our friends and it was SO MUCH FUN!! We went and watched a dance concert, dressed up and took pictures, watched movies, and ate Thai food. I love Thai food.<br>
			Now I'm back at college on my grind. My mom is so nice, she sent me a popcorn popper! I love popcorn, but honestly I think she loves it more so it's a big deal that she gave up her popper for me.<br>
			Anyway, for real people, go out and vote. Also, nobody has Venmo'd me money and I'm dissapointed. I'm bringing you <i>PREMIUM</i> level content for free here.

			So it was my older brother's birthday today so that's neat he's a cool guy. School is very uhhhhhh much the same as it always is.<br> 
			Today I caught a Charizard in a raid in Pokemon Go so that's cool. Pokemon Go is super fun and all of you should download it (not a paid ad). <br>
			Okay thanks for tuning in have a good day. :)

			Alright folks, today I have great news for you. Two of my favorite Kpop groups released new music today! TWICE released a full length album, 
			and TXT released an EP. If you haven't listened to them yet that's fine just please don't talk to me until you have :)<br>
			In other news, the Halloween event in Pokemon GO is still happening, and me and my room mate just tried to fight a Gengar in a raid and LOST TWICE?!?! This Gengar is so strong for real, dang.<br>
			It's getting super cold where I live. Today I walked outside to play Pokemon GO and it was seriously 21 degrees. Who let this happen? I'm not sure but I have mixed feelings about it.<br>
			Anyway, thanks for tuning in, have a great day.

		Wow, today is the day huh? This is the first time ever making an entry into my blog. Hi, mom!<br> I guess I'd like to start this blog off right by pandering for money.
		Seriously, loyal readers, I'm broke. If you've got spare money, please send it to me. <br>Why should you send me your money? Simple.
		I'm super humble, and therefore deserve it. My venmo information is in the footer. Thank you and have a good day.
