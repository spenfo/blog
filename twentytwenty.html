		Wow, today is the day huh? This is the first time ever making an entry into my blog. Hi, mom! I guess I'd like to start this blog off right by pandering for money. Seriously, loyal readers, I'm broke. If you've got spare money, please send it to me. Why should you send me your money? Simple. I'm super humble, and therefore deserve it. My venmo information is in the footer. Thank you and have a good day.
