			Alright folks, today I have great news for you. Two of my favorite Kpop groups released new music today! TWICE released a full length album, 
			and TXT released an EP. If you haven't listened to them yet that's fine just please don't talk to me until you have :)<br>
			In other news, the Halloween event in Pokemon GO is still happening, and me and my room mate just tried to fight a Gengar in a raid and LOST TWICE?!?! This Gengar is so strong for real, dang.<br>
			It's getting super cold where I live. Today I walked outside to play Pokemon GO and it was seriously 21 degrees. Who let this happen? I'm not sure but I have mixed feelings about it.<br>
			Anyway, thanks for tuning in, have a great day.

		Wow, today is the day huh? This is the first time ever making an entry into my blog. Hi, mom!<br> I guess I'd like to start this blog off right by pandering for money.
		Seriously, loyal readers, I'm broke. If you've got spare money, please send it to me. <br>Why should you send me your money? Simple.
		I'm super humble, and therefore deserve it. My venmo information is in the footer. Thank you and have a good day.
